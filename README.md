# Radius-of-Non-singularity-using-QAOA

In this repository, the binary optimization problem of the Radius of Non-Singularity is solved using a quantum algorithm with the QAOA framework.
The Code follows along the according paper "Using quantum computers in control: interval matrix properties" [Jan Schneider, Julian Berberich, European Control Conference, 2024].
The goal is to emphasize the future use of quantum algorithms for control theory.

The repository contains one main script which allows explains the procedure of the quantum algorithm step by step. 

For the implementation, the PennyLane toolbox is used.
